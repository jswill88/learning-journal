# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript
## How to write script for a web page
* HTML is the content layer, CSS is the Presentation Layer, and Javascript is the Behavior layer
* The HTML `<script>` is used to load Javascript into the page
* In the example `document.write('Good afternoon!');`
  * `document` is the **object**
  * `.` is the member **operator**
  * `write()` is the **method**
  * `'Good afternoon!'` is the **parameter**

## Basic Javascript Instructions
* A **statement** is an individual instruction or step
  * For example `var today = new Date();`
  * each one starts on a new line
* `/* comments in between */` or `// comments here`
* A **variable** is a bit of script that can store information
* In the example `var quantity`:
  * `var` is the variable keyword
  * `quantitiy` is the variable name
* `=` is an assignment operator
* You assign a variable with a variable value
* Data types: Numeric, String, Boolean
* You can change the value of a variable
