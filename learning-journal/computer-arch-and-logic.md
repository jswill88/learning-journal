# Computer Architecture and Logic

## What makes a computer a computer?
* They have four features: take input, store information, process information, and output results
* Input converts physical info to binary info. Ways of input:
  * Mouse
  * Keyboard
  * Microphone
  * Camera
  * Touch Screen
  * GPS
* Memory stores the input
* The CPU processes info to prepare it for output
 * Output converts the binary into a physical output. Types of output include:
   * Screen, robot signals, internet, sound

## Data and Binary
* Almost nobody works with binary
* Wires and circuits carry info on a computer. Signals are on or off, and they represent one bit.
* More bits allow for more complexity
* All things on a computer are represented with numbers, including text, graphics and sound

## Circuits and Logic
* A computer modifies and combines input signals usign circuits to combine and process numbers
* Smaller circuits are faster
