# Learning Markdown

## Guide for Using Markdown

#### Headers:
* Use `#` for h1, `##` for h2, etc.
#### Emphasis
* `*italics*` = *italics*
* `**bold**` = **bold**  
* `~~strikethrough~~` = ~~strikethrough~~
* `` `code` `` = `code`
#### Lists
* Put a ```*``` or ```-``` at the beginning of a line to make an unordered list.  
* Write a ```1.``` at the beginning of each line for an ordered list.  
* For nested items, put two spaces before the bullet or number.
* ```-[x]``` makes a task list
#### Image
* ```![Alt Text](url)```
#### Links
* Urls automatically become links
* ```[Google](www.google.com)``` = [Google](www.google.com)
#### Table

```Make | Model```   
```-------|------ ```  
```Content | Content ```

becomes:

 Make | Model   
-------|------ 
Content | Content
