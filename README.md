# Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is important for learning new skills effectively. People with fixed mindsets will not have the drive to accomplish new goals, because they will believe that their current skill level will not change with study and practice. They will look at successful people and believe that their success is a result of innate talent. People with growth mindsets know that success is the result of practice, study, and determination. They know that failure is part of the process, and they will not be discouraged when faced with difficult tasks. This is important for anybody who is taking an intennse course like this, and it is important for learning *any* new skill in the future. :muscle: :punch:

### Reminders
1. **This is something new, be patient, and stick with it**
1. **Some people have been doing this for years, so don't try to compete. Learn from them**
1. **Take a step back and look at the progress you've already made. It shows that you will continue to make progress**
